All the commands below work both if you're connecting to a [remote node](./getting-started#connecting-to-an-existing-network) or to [your own local node](./getting-started#running-a-localnet).

Regen provides three interfaces for interacting with your node: a command-line interface (CLI), a gRPC endpoint and a REST API.

### Command-line Interface
